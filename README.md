This is a Scratch "programming langauge" that I made.

To use this file, go to scratch.mit.edu or any other Scratch client and import the sprite. Then, use the functions to create a program. Make when showing images, to have the costume name start with "app."
For example:
--------------------
app.player
--------------------
